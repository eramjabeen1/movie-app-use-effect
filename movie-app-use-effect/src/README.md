## What I Learned

- How to actually *use* useEffect instead of just pretending I understood it
- That passing props between components isnâ€™t as scary as it looks
- How to connect a real API and see live data show up on the screen
- That one typo in the API key can ruin everything feel free to ask me how I know
- How to build and style a simple app that actually works and looks decent
